      <img src="assets/images/FullSizeACLB.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I have been working in the medical aesthetics industry for 10 years. After attending Colorado State, I pursued my interest in skincare by becoming a licensed medical esthetician. My degree and license have been a beneficial resource to grow within my industry.</p>

      <p>By educating myself on social media platforms, online marketing, as well as, traditional marketing strategies I found my true passion and I competently have expanded my role and have had continued success. In 2012 I relocated to California and truly have loved being in the Los Angeles area ever since.  I particularly like the downtown area the most.</p>
